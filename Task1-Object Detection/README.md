In this repo, you'll find codes for 
- Object detection on Image 
- Object detection on Videos (Live webcam in google colab and anaconda environment)

## Object Detection on Image

- :rocket: Model Architecture : Using pre-trained Faster-RCNN and InceptionResNetV2 feature extractor(acting as backbone) to identify objects in images and webcam. InceptionResNetV3 was trained on [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) and fine-tuned with FasterRCNN on [OpenImages V4 dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html), containing 600 classes.
This pre-trained model is taken from [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub).

1. Import Libraries 
2. Image Preprocessing 
3. Draw bounding box and class name on the image
4. Detector 
5. Take photo from webcam
6. Download pretrained model and predict
